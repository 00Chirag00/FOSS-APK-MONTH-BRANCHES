My favorite Third Year Senior is Garvit Chittora Sir.
Firstly, because he is the Overall Coordinator of GeekHaven
Secondly, during HINT orientation was really good to interact with him and some other third years as well.

My favourite Second Year Senior is Raghav Goel Sir.
Firstly, explained the concepts in the FOSS class quite well.
Secondly, found him quite cool in senior-junior interactions as well.
